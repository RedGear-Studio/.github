# RedGear Studio

RedGear Studio is a community of passionate developers who create open source tools and applications for the community. We are committed to creating high-quality software and sharing our knowledge with others.

## Our projects

Here are the current projects being developed at RedGear Studio:

  - **[Reg-Lang](https://github.com/RedGear-Studio/Reg-Lang)**: A virtual machine (VM) for the Reg-Lang language, that can execute bytecode instructions. It has 64 registers, each capable of storing 64 bits of binary data, and can execute several opcodes. The ``v0.0.1 alpha`` is planned to be released in the summer holidays with the release of the compiler. For now, there's a compiler for our own Assembly but you can't really do something interesting with this assembly because there are no libs nor APIs.
  - **Stamina**: Our upcoming game is a sandbox-style MORPG set in a unique mix of Steampunk and Cyberpunk world. In the game, players will need to survive each day while managing their cities and utilizing available resources and technologies. As a player, you will have the freedom to build, modify and update cities according to your needs and preferences. We're excited to bring this world to life and offer players an immersive gameplay experience in a richly detailed game world.
